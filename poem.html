     <h1 style="font-size: 34px;"> IN THE TRENCHES ~ Siegfried Sassoon</h1>
     <p>i knew a simple soldier boy <br>
        who grinned at life in empty joy, <br>
        slept soundly through the lonesome dark, <br>
        and whistled early with the lark. <br> 
        <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;   *                  
        <br>
        <br>

       
            in winter trenches, cowed and glum,<br>
            with crumps and lice and lack of rum,<br>
            he put a bullet through his brain. <br>
            no one spoke of him again. <br>
        <br>
     
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;   *                  
         <br>
         <br>
        you smug-faced crowds with kindling eye<br>
        who cheer when soldier lads march by,<br>
        sneak home and pray you'll never know <br>
        The hell where youth and laughter go.
